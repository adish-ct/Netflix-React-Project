Router

index.js

if we want to use routing with button we need to use useHistory ( ) hook

<BrowseRouter>
<App />
</BrowseRouter>

create a constant for useHistory()
 
const history = useHistory()
<button onClick={()=> history.push('/url_path')}> click </button>

or we can use Link instead of button

<Link to='/url_path' > click </Link>

context api - data passed without props mainly used in nested components, avoiding unwanted passing of props.
globally saved and access anywhere without passing to any component.
